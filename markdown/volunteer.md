Volunteer
=========

We provide accomodation and 3 vegan meals in exchange for 36 hours of work every week. You work 6 hours for 6 days and get one day off each week. The day you arrive is your first day off. We ask for a minimuim 2 week commitment.

The work you will be around **Animal Enrichment**, **Farm work**, and **Housekeeping**. More specifically Dog walks, brushing animals, poop scooping, flea and tick removal, baths, laundry, feeding infant puppies, playing with dogs, maintaining community space, assisting in the [farm](/?p=farm) (weeding, mulching, preparing new farm patches, digging, planting, moving rocks), [stray animal recovery center](/?p=recovery), kitchen and construction projects. You might also be working alongside a staff member to assist with animal treatments.

Apart from that, you're also welcome to use your skills to help us do more good work or improve the space. People have contributed by doing art all around the farm, making videos, carpentry, [teaching kids in the village](/?p=village) and doing [hacktivism](/?p=hacktivism)!


Our Expectations
---------

This is a karma yoga place.

We expect people to be honest, calm, respectful, responsible, hard working, compassionate, motivated by doing good work, have attention to detail, and keep the space clean. The work we do is also very physical, so please consider your own energy level and if you will find it rewarding. We expect you to follow the schedule of the farm, which includes early mornings. If you are unable to follow the schedule or if we have to pick up after you, or constantly remind you of the [rules](/?p=rules) you will be asked to leave.

We expect people to understand that this is rural India and not do things which offends local senibilities.

This is our home and this is our life, which we are sharing with any one who wants to do good work. If you realize that, and understand that this will not only be your work place during your stay, but will also be your home, you will fit right in.

If you are looking for a getaway and not for an opportunity to help animals, then this is a not the place for you.

Routine
-----------
The farm operates on a schedule and routine. Work happens in three shifts and meals are at specific times. Volunteers should arrive and depart within certain times, and will be expected to follow the schedule while at the farm. 

If you find the same thing for an extended period boring instead of meditative, or having a routine is not something you like, then this is not a good fit for you.

**Please read the ENTIRE [FAQ](/?p=faq) and [Rules](/?p=rules) before applying!**
