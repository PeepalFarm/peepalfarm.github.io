We take pride in making all our products, especially our Peanut Butter. It's our bestseller for a reason and that reason is simple - it's made with care and love. We roast the peanuts on a traditional _chulah_ (wood fired stove) until they gets a golden glow. Then, they are ground up in our home blender, in our kitchen by Mamta - a talented girl from the village. Each jar is hand-filled with the smooth, silky goodness of the redskin-on peanut butter and decorated with home toasted cacao!

* No added salt
* No added sugar
* No palm oil

**Ingredients:** Peanuts, Coconut oil, Cacao (optional) 

### Rs. 125
