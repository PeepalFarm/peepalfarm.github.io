Village Programs
==

* To do our bit for improving the village we are in, we have started "[google for girls](/?p=google-for-girls)" program and also do english, art, music and self defense classes depending on the teachers available. 

* There is a free library for girls in the village. The library has a few books but also offers them a safe space if they are from a troubled family.
