This is what we deal with. And frankly, we are a little tired of it. So, we decided that we need to change how farmers act towards stray cows.
Farmers do have a choice to chase away cows with water and that is the only legal choice. Still, they use sticks and sickles and cows lose horns and cows get fractures and maggot wounds. This is not right. We thought if they are not afraid of the law, maybe they will be afraid of the Lord.

Today it begins. It does not have to stay in our little village. This should spread all over India and only you can help spread it. This should become trendy, and you can be the trend setter. Either pick up a paintbrush and some sacks, or **SHARE** this ‪#‎culturejam‬ to inspire others.
