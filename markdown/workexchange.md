Title: Work Exchange

-->

Work Exchange
=========

We provide accomodation and 3 vegan meals in exchange for 36 hours of work every week. You work 6 hours for 6 days and get one day off each week. The day you arrive is your first day off.

The work you will do depends on your work exchange position. These are the available work excahnge positions:

* **Animal Enrichment:** Dog walks, brushing animals, poop scooping, flea and tick removal, baths, laundry, feeding infant puppies, and playing. Must be willing to work with all types of animals.


Outside of your position duties, you will be asked to help with daily chores (housekeeping and assisting cook), assisting in the [farm](/?p=farm) (weeding, mulching, digging holes, collecting rocks), or assisting medical staff in the [stray animal recovery center](/?p=recovery).

We don't ask for a specific skill set, but you're welcome to use your skills to help us do more good work or improve the space. People have contributed by doing art all around the farm, teaching kids in the village and doing hactivism!

Our Expectations
---------

We expect people to be honest, respectful, responsible, hard working, compassionate, motivated by doing good work, have attention to detail, and keep the space clean. The work we do is also very physical, so please consider your own energy level and if you will find it rewarding. We expect you to follow the schedule of the farm, which includes early mornings. If you are unable to follow the schedule, you will be asked to leave.

This is our home and this is our life, which we are sharing with any one who wants to do good work. We do not ask you to do anything we don't do ourselves. If you realize that, and understand that this will not only be your work place during your stay, but will also be your home, you will fit right in.
