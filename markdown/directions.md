Bus
=========
From Dharamsala Bus Stand (the one in Dharamsala, not McLeod) ask for a bus towards Chari (pronounced chuh-ree). Then tell the conductor you are going to Dhanotu (duh-no-too) stop - at the bus shelter, next to the temple. If you see the Home Gaurd on your right, you have gone too far! You can exit the bus there and walk back a few minutes. 

When you get off the bus, take the first road to the left (away from the big cliff overlooking the river). The road goes almost parallel to the highway for a while, then turns left. Follow the road and look for a door with Shiva and a cow painted on it. That is us! If you have any problems you can [Contact us]( ?contact "Contact" ) or just ask anyone for "animal place".

Car or Taxi
==========
From Dharamsala Bus Stand (the one in Dharamsala, not McLeod) take the road downhill towards Gharoh. Keep driving downhill (past Gharoh and Chari) to the Dhanotu stop (at the bus shelter, next to the mandir). 

Take the road across from the bus shelter to the left (away from the big cliff overlooking the river). This road goes almost parallel to the highway for a while, then turns left. Follow the road and look for a door with Shiva and a cow painted on it. That is us! If you have any problems you can [Contact us]( ?contact "Contact" ) or just ask anyone for "animal place".

Plane
==========
From Guggal airport take a bus or taxi towards Chambi Pul. At the intersection in Chambi, turn right (do not cross the bridge). If you are taking the bus, get down at Chambi and take a bus uphill towards Chari.

Continue uphill past the Home Gaurd center. When you see the Dhanotu bus shelter on the left (next to the temple) turn right. The road goes almost parallel to the highway for a while, then turns left. Follow the road and look for a door with Shiva and a cow painted on it. That is us! If you have any problems you can [Contact us]( ?contact "Contact" ) or just ask anyone for "animal place".

Train
==========
From the train station in Pathankot, take a taxi towards Dharamsala. You will pass Shahpur and then Rait, then after you cross the next bridge (at Chambi) take the immediate left to go uphill. 

Continue uphill past the Home Gaurd center. When you see the Dhanotu bus shelter on the left (next to the temple) turn right. The road goes almost parallel to the highway for a while, then turns left. Follow the road and look for a door with Shiva and a cow painted on it. That is us!
