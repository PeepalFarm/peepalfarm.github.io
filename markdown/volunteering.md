Volunteering
==========

Our volunteer program is for folks who want to work with us for 3 days or more. We do not provide housing for volunteers, so you will have to arrange for a place to stay (hotel, guesthouse, or homestay). We can offer suggestions of nearby places upon request.

As a volunteer you will participate in ongoing activity by working alongside a staff member. This can mean helping in the kitchen, in the farm, or assisting with animal treatments. 

If you are inclined, you can do your own projects like community classes, making videos, helping with adoptions, fundraising, etc.
