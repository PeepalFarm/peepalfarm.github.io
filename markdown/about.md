About us
======

We are a group of loosely knit, creatively maladjusted people doing short term animal welfare via **direct impact**, and long term animal rights work via **hacktivism**. 

"**[Badmash Peepal Farm]( /?p=farm)**" is a home built in Himalayan Foothills to accommodate recovering injured stray animals, creatively maladjusted people who want to help do animal welfare and animal rights, and an organic farm to provide a little bit for for all of us.

## Philosophy

We believe that every action has a suffering footprint, especially any consumption. So we believe in mindful consumption and living purposefully. We have set our purpose to do good, and we believe in "alleviating physical pain" as an objective net good.
