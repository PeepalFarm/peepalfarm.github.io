###[Badmash Peepal Farm](?about "About" )
Our farm and community space near Dharamsala, at the foothills of the Himalayas, where culture jammers, hactivists and change-makers can either help us run our welfare programs for stray animals or propose and implement a project to help animals in another way.

###[ABC Co-operative](?ABC-Cooperative "ABC Co-operative" )
----------
The ABC Co-operative connects stray dog feeders, ambulances, vets, post-op care centers, and donors to sterilize stray dogs, area-by-area.

Past
----------
###Friends of ARK
For 12 years Avis, founder of Animal Rescue Kerala, built and managed an incredible shelter in Kovalam. However she became ill, and wished to return to her home in the UK. We assisted in re-homing dogs and searching for an organization to continue ABC in her facility.

###[Friends of IACC](http://foiacc.worldlywags.org/ "FOIACC" )
----------
FoIACC was our very first project. IACC was founded by a group of people in 2005, but for many years had been taken care of by only one person, Lorraine. There were too many animals at the shelter for one person to manage, and Lorraine was exhausted from overwork. We decided to help her fix the place up and find help, and we found a new person to replace Lorraine in managing the center.
