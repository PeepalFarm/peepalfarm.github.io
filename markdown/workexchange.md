Work Exchange
=========

We provide accomodation and 3 vegan meals in exchange for 36 hours of work every week. You work 6 hours for 6 days and get one day off each week. The day you arrive is your first day off. We ask for a minimuim 2 week commitment.

The work you will be around **Animal Enrichment**, **Farm work**, and **Housekeeping**. More specifically Dog walks, brushing animals, poop scooping, flea and tick removal, baths, laundry, feeding infant puppies, playing with dogs, maintaing community space, assisting in the [farm](/?p=farm) (weeding, mulching, preparing new farm patches, digging, planting, moving rocks), [stray animal recovery center](/?p=recovery), kitchen and construction projects.

Apart from that, you're also welcome to use your skills to help us do more good work or improve the space. People have contributed by doing art all around the farm, making videos, carpentry, [teaching kids in the village](/?p=village) and doing [hacktivism](/?p=hacktivism)!


Our Expectations
---------

We expect people to be honest, respectful, responsible, hard working, compassionate, motivated by doing good work, have attention to detail, and keep the space clean. The work we do is also very physical, so please consider your own energy level and if you will find it rewarding. We expect you to follow the schedule of the farm, which includes early mornings. If you are unable to follow the schedule or if we have to pick up after you, you will be asked to leave.

This is our home and this is our life, which we are sharing with any one who wants to do good work. If you realize that, and understand that this will not only be your work place during your stay, but will also be your home, you will fit right in.

Are you looking for something with a more flexible schedule? Check out **[volunteering](/?p=volunteering)** instead!

**Please read the ENTIRE [FAQ](/?p=faq) and [Rules](/?p=rules) before applying!**
