About us
==========

![](/markdown/E-COVER-WEBSITE.jpg)

We are a group of loosely knit, creatively maladjusted people doing short term animal welfare via **direct impact**, and long term animal rights work via **hacktivism**. 

We run a **[stray dog sterilization program](/?p=abc-cooperative)** in New Delhi and a **[stray animal recovery center](/?p=farm#animals)** for large and small animals in our farm near Dharamsala." 

"**[Badmash Peepal Farm]( /?p=farm)**" is a home built to accommodate recovering injured stray animals, creatively maladjusted people who want to help do animal welfare and animal rights, and a natural, organic farm to provide a little bit for for all of us.

***Philosophy***

We believe that every action has a suffering footprint, especially any consumption. So we believe in mindful consumption and living purposefully. We have set our purpose to do good, and we believe in "alleviating physical pain" as an objective net good.
