Bus
=========
From Dharamsala Bus Stand (the one in Dharamsala, not McLeod) ask for a bus towards Chari (pronounced chuh-ree). Then tell the conductor you are going to Dhanotu stop (at the bus shelter, next to the mandir). 

When you get off the bus, take the first road to the left (away from the big cliff overlooking the river). The road goes almost parallel to the highway for a while, then there is a fork in the road. Turn left at the fork and look for a door with Shiva and a cow painted on it. That is us! If you have any problems you can [Contact us]( #contact "Contact" ) or just ask anyone for "animal place".
