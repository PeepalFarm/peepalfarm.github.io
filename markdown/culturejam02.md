Street Art for Street Dogs.
=====

In India, while dogs are dying on street, majority of people insist on buying a dog from a breeder. Not only did making this art engage close to a hundred people in a matter of hours sensitivizing them to this issue, but this picture on a real wall will continue to inspire for months to come. It will make its way to Facebook walls when people take and post selfies.

"[Desi Log Desi Dog](/?p=desilogdesidog)" literally translates to "Local people Local dog", which is what we are using to promote people to adopt, and not shop for a dog. Afterall, you can't buy a friend!
