About us
======

## Who we are

Badmash Peepal is a group of loosely knit people with one goal; doing good work.  We believe in "alleviating physical pain" as an objective net good. So for us, good work is helping alleviate suffering of those who can't help themselves. 

"**[Peepal Farm]( /?p=farm)**" is our home space built in Himalayan Foothills to accommodate recovering injured stray animals, creatively maladjusted people who want to do good work, and an organic farm to provide a little bit for for all of us.

## Current Mission

It's dual prong. We are doing short term **service** by doing animal welfare in our stray animal recovery center, and we are contributing towards long term fixes by encouraging and enabling compassion towards animals. Our methods of choice for that are **[hacktivism](/?p=hacktivism)**, **community organization** and **[good enterprise](/?p=good-enterprise)**.  

## Vision

Bring together a group of people which will continue doing and inspiring good work, and also attempt to bring about lasting change via **awareness** (<i>education</i> + <i>culture jamming</i>), **innovation** and **policy**.

## Philosophy

We believe that every action for survival has a suffering footprint, especially any consumption. So, we believe in mindful consumption and making our survival purposeful by alleviateing suffering.
