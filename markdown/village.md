Village Programs
==

* To do our bit for improving the village we are in, we have started "[google for girls](/?p=google-for-girls)" program and also do english, art and self defense classes depending on the teachers available. 

* There is a free library for girls in the village. The library has a few books but also offers them a safe space if they are from a troubled family.

* To help our neighbors who do not want to abandon their non producing cattle, but financially find it difficult to keep them, we are working on [infrastructure to utilize cow dung](https://blog.badmashpeepal.org/how-to-replace-plastic-with-cow-poop-in-5-steps-dff17bec1c66#.hgh35rvlm) and cow urine so maintenance cost for keeping retired cattle can be offset.
