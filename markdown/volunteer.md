Volunteer Program
==========

Our volunteer program is for folks who want to work with us for 3 days or more. We do not provide meals or housing for volunteers, so you will have to arrange for a place to stay (hotel or homestay). We can offer suggestions of nearby places upon request.

As a volunteer you will participate in ongoing activity by working alongside a staff member. This can meanassisting with animal treatments, helping in farm, kitchen and construction projects.

If you are inclined, you can do your own projects like community classes, making videos for adoption and awareness, fundraising, writing articles etc.

The farm operates on a schedule and routine. Volunteers should expect to arrive and depart within certain times, and will be asked to manage tasks on a schedule while at the farm.
