The ABC Co-operative
==========

We believe that until the number of homes equals the number of dogs, their population needs to be reduced. 
----------


**The ABC Co-operative is working prototype that connects people and organizations to create a distributed network.** 

No single individual or organization is completely responsible for it to function, making it scalable and sustainable. This means linking dog caretakers, veterinarians, transportation, donors, and foster homes to complete the entire process of sterilization. 

We provide coordination as well as a tangible infrastructure of transport vehicle, driver, dog handler, and a post-op facility. As of June 7th, 2016, the infrastructure service will be provided at no cost.


**We try to sterilize dogs area-by-area in the most efficient use of resources.** 

Dog caretakers become neighborhood guardians who maintain their area and sterilize any new dogs. 

**That way when we sterilize an area, it stays that way.**
