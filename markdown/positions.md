 We give injured stray animals a place to heal before they are released back to the street. We have dogs, puppies, mules, cows, and calves in residence and recovery. We are a small operation with no official hotline, so the number and intensity of in-patient cases vary greatly.

* Ensuring that animals are up to date on their vaccines and deworming schedules
* Brainstorming and researching new methods for improved care and living
* Working with volunteer co-ordinator to assign volunteers and oversee volunteer work
* Innovating and researching solutions for healthcare and enrichment
* Creating a "Treat on Street" program which identifies animals on the road which can be treated in place and provides care, vaccines, and sterilization.

### Skills:

* Veterinary skills (Veterinary doctor, technician, assistant, or nurse) are a must

We believe strongly in using only local, preferable under utilized  (extra herbs, extra produce) or unused resources (like waste eggshells, cow dung, cloth scraps, wood shavings, dog hair) and unemployed youth to create a product. We also believe in only creating products which actually solve a need and not create a need for their own consumption. Products should be such that their consumption reduces the impact on environment in comparison to whatever product they will replace.
