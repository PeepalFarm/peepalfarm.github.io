[title]: # (ABOUT US)

ABOUT

Badmash Peepal Farm is an **organic farm** and **stray animal recovery
center** for large and small animals near Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh. We promote sustainable living and offer a program where people from around the world can work in exchange for vegan meals and accommodation.

Our main priority is the health of the animals we treat and rehabilitate. **We are committed to alleviating the suffering of any animal that requires aid.** Many of the animals were brought in having sustained serious injuries, mostly due to accidents and abuse.

In the future we aim to be totally self sustainable. The farm is a work in progress and so far we have been able to harvest some herbs and vegetables from our expanding garden.

The help we need ranges from daily tasks - like dog walks, housekeeping, farm work, assistance with animal treatments, and spending time with the animals - to skilled work - like art, media and outreach, hecktivism, permaculture, carpentry, or sustainable building.
