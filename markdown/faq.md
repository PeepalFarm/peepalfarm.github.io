Work Exchange Frequently Asked Questions
=========

## What should I bring?
We suggest you bring your own toiletries (preferably bio-degradable), toilet paper, a towel, a flash light,a pair of CLOSED TOE work shoes, slippers for the kitchen, a rain jacket, a sweater or jacket, water bottle, bug spray, and a sleeping sack. Bring clothes that you don't mind getting dirty and sweaty!

## Do you have internet?
Yes. Usually it's good enough for WhatsApp, E-mail, and Facebook but we can't gurantee its availability. If you desperately need internet, bring your own 3G data stick. Tata Photon and Idea seem to work best here.

## Do you provide a pick-up?
Sorry, no. However, you can get taxis and buses from bus station in Dharamsala, and if you are coming via flight you can arrange a pickup from a taxi service or take two local buses. We can provide you a few phone numbers.

## Do you provide meals?
We provide 3 vegan meals on all of your working days. Meals on your day off are your responsibility.

## How many people participate in the work exchange at one time?
Although it varies depending on available positions, we usually have two workers at one time. Sometimes you may be the only one, so please be prepared to get to know staff, locals, volunteers, and visitors!

Not So Frequently Asked Questions
=========

## Are there snakes at the farm?
We don't have permanent resident snakes, but we have seen a few on and around the farm. Himachal does boast some of India's most venemous snakes.

## Do you have hot showers?
We have bucket showers in the community bathroom. There is a water heater and you can fill up a bucket of hot water.

## How is the cellphone signal?
The nearest cell phone tower is still pretty far, so the signal is spotty but not too horrible. The walls are 18" thick and it's hard to get signal inside the rooms. 

## Do you have western toilets?
Yes. 

## How will I do laundry?
You can either do your laundry by hand (soap not provided) in our bucket or you can pay for a machine wash at Rs 65/kg.
