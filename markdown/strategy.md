Title: Strategy

Strategy
==

We have chosen to focus on non-wild animals, which we categorise in Companion animals, and Farm animals. Our primary objective is to alter human behavior to get these non human animals seen as beings which feel pain not unlike human animals. In broad strokes, that behavior manifests as,

* People offering water, food, medical care or shelter to homeless companion animals.
* Keeping products derived from farm animals off their plates.

Although we don't do animal welfare as a tactic, we do use it as a vehicle to generate media content and stories which carry our message in a way that would tug at heartstrings of people. 

Tactics
==

One to one 
--

* Our farm silently blurs the imaginary boundaries that people have between farm and companion animals (example: they save dogs and eat cows)

* Our farm highlights the suffering footprint of any consumption and nudges people to more mindful consumption.

One to many 
--
Our current approach is to piggyback on interests of many (food, fashion and entertainment) and align the packaging of our message with the interest of providers of food, fashion and entertainment.

* We started a product line (peanut butter, vegantella, snack etc.) and people now pay us to have our message being displayed in their stores and consumers are paying to read our message :)

* We give a "vegan friendly" sticker to any restaurant which has enough vegan options (so any indian restaurant). They get more business from vegans and we get to expose all the non vegans going to that restaurant to the word vegan and open a curiosity gap.

* We've started selling Tofu as a healtheir and chepaer alternative to Paneer (Indian cottage cheese).

* Plan for a reality tv style web series is in works.
