We created the unreal "Feed a Stray Dog Body Donation Program" to shed light on a very real issue. There are millions of stray dogs around the world who struggle to survive every day. They struggle with injury, disease, and cruelty, but they also simply hungry. Their most basic needs of food, water, and shelter are not available to them. We think that this is wrong.

Inept governments across the globe are unable to control the number of unwanted dogs. We want governments to create rigorous spay and neuter programs and laws which sterilize strays and eliminate backyard breeders who add to the problem. We also ask that citizens recognize how real dog overpopulation is and take active steps to choose pets from shelters and rescues rather than purchasing dogs and adding to the suffering.
