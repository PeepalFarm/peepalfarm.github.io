Good Enterprise
==

We believe, for an enterprise to do net good -

* It should create a product from locally available material, ideally something which is not already being used.
* Do not compete. If the problem you are trying to solve is being solved by someone else, your strengths are better used elsewhere on a problem no one is thinking about.
* The product should not be a filler. It should solve an issue better than its counterparts (if there are any) and do it in a more compassionate way.
* The enterprise will be helping a few people gain monetary resources. Ensure that those people also get exposure to compassion so the resources used are not in a counter productive way.
