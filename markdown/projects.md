PROJECTX

Badmash Peepal Farm is an **organic farm** and **stray animal recovery
center** for large and small animals in Dhanotu village, near
Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh. We promote sustainable living and offer
a work exchange program where people from all around the world can  for vegan meals and accommodation.

Our main priority is the health and upkeep of the animals we
treat and rehabilitate. **We aim to alleviate the suffering of any
animal that requires aid.** Many of the animals were brought in having
sustained serious injuries, mostly due to accidents and abuse.

 The farm is a work in progress and so far we have been able to
harvest some herbs and vegetables from our expanding
garden. In the future we aim to be totally self sustainable.

The help we need ranges from daily tasks - like dog walks, housekeeping, farm work, assistance with animal treatments, and spending time with the animals - to skilled work - like art, media and outreach, hecktivism, permaculture, carpentry, or sustainable building.
