## Domestic Adoptions (India)

If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs and you are in India, we have many loving pups in need of happy, forever homes. All of our dogs for adoption are healthy, and up to date on vaccines and deworming.

To get started, please fill out a [Domestic Adoptions Form](https://goo.gl/forms/qBiWrmfDxJKk3DqG2).


## International Adoptions

Our international adoptions program gives you the opportunity to provide a safe and happy home to one of our rescued dogs, no matter where you live. These puppies cannot be returned to the street because of health or age, and so need to find permanent, loving homes so that we can keep our doors open to new animals in need of rescue. All of our dogs for adoption are healthy, and up to date on vaccines and deworming.

Before they fly, we do the necessary paperwork, microchipping, and flight arrangements. For dogs who are old enough we also do their sterilization surgery and necessary blood work. We require a scan of your passport and driver's license, your phone number, and you must pick the dog(s) up from the airport.
