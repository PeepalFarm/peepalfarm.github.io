We provide accomodation and 3 vegan meals in exchange for 36 hours of work every week. You work 6 hours for 6 days and get one day off each week. The work including daily chores related to maintaining [stray animal recovery center](/?p=recovery), the [farm](/?p=farm) and [farmstay](/?p=farmstay). You will be doing dog walks, poop pickup, weeding, mulching, digging holes, collecting rocks, brushing animals, playing fetch, helping in cooking, helping in housekeeping, help in feeding etc.

We don't ask for a specific skill set, but your are welcome to use your skills to help us do more good work or improve the space. People have contributed by doing art all around the farm, teaching kids in the village and doing hactivism!

We expect people to be honest, respectful, responsible, hard working, compassionate, motivated by doing good work, have attention to detail and a generally acceptable standard of cleanliness.

This is our home and this is our life, which we are sharing with any one who wants to do good work. If you realize that, and understand that this will not only be your work place during your stay, but will also be your home, you will fit right in.
