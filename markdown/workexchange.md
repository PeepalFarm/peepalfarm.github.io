Our Expectations
---------

We expect people to be honest, respectful, responsible, hard working, compassionate, motivated by doing good work, have attention to detail, and keep the space clean. The work we do is also very physical, so please consider your own energy level and if you will find it rewarding. We expect you to follow the schedule of the farm, which includes early mornings. If you are unable to follow the schedule or if we have to pick up after you, you will be asked to leave.

This is our home and this is our life, which we are sharing with any one who wants to do good work. We do not ask you to do anything we don't do ourselves. If you realize that, and understand that this will not only be your work place during your stay, but will also be your home, you will fit right in.

Are you looking for something with a more flexible schedule? Check out **[volunteering](/?p=volunteering)** instead!
