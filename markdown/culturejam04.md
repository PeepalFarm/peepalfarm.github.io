 Self propogating street art for street dogs.
=====

Our [old graffiti](/?p=culturejam02) in McLeodGanj (Himachal Pradesh) had gotten really nasty, and needed a makeover. We decided to make it a more prominent selfie spot this time :) With a couple of artists, a puppy in tow, a 8 year old puppy nanny and friends helping out with crowd control and food supply, we were able to pull this off in 6 hours :) Every one from cops to local shopkeepers to people passing by were so helpful! Doing good feels great :D

"[Desi Log Desi Dog](/?p=desilogdesidog)" literally translates to "Local people Local dog", which is what we are using to promote people to adopt, and not shop for a dog. Afterall, you can't buy a friend!
