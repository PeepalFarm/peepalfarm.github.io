Street Art for Street Dogs.
=====

In India, while dogs are dying on street, majority of people insist on buying a dog from a breeder. Not only did making this art engage close to a hundred people in a matter of hours sensitivizing them to this issue, but this picture on a real wall will continue to inspire for months to come. It will make its way to Facebook walls when people take and post selfies.

"Desi Log Desi Dog" literally translates to "Local people Local dog", which is what we are using to promote people to adopt, and not shop for a dog. Afterall, you can't buy a friend!
