Truth behind "Donate your body to help Strays dogs"
======

"[Donate Your Body to help Stray Dogs](/human/)" campaign was NOT REAL and is just meant to grab attention. The issue is very REAL. There are millions of stray dogs around the world who struggle to survive every day. They struggle with injury, disease, and cruelty, but they also simply hungry. Their most basic needs of food, water, and shelter are not available to them. This is wrong!

People get desensitized this issue as they are over exposed to it seeing homeless animals everyday. These animals become invisible. We want to shake them into seeing strays and their plight again. It should not have taken this extreme thought to get them talking about feeding leftovers to strays or running effective sterlizations programs, but we have to compete with billion dollar companies for your attention. Sorry.

Inept governments across the globe are unable to control the number of unwanted dogs. [In Kerala, India, dogs are being beaten to death as a public sport](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-subsidised-air-guns-gold-coins-for-culling-stray-dogs-in-kerala/story-JDBm1Y70rFpRoW5ocRNsGI.html) in the name of population control. In China, they are eating stray dogs as a festival! We want governments to create rigorous spay and neuter programs and laws which sterilize strays and eliminate backyard breeders who add to the problem. We also ask that citizens recognize how real dog overpopulation is and take active steps to choose pets from shelters and rescues rather than purchasing dogs and adding to the suffering.
