Sterilizations
----------

**What is your sterilization service?**

We help you do sterilizations. From end to end a sterilization requires catching, transportation, surgery, post-operative care, and fundraising. We ask you to do what you can, and we will fill in the gaps. Read more about the ABC Co-operative here!

**Which dogs do you sterilize?**

We only sterilize stray female dogs who are 7 months or older. If the dog has had pups recently, they must be at least 3 months old.

**Is there any risk to the dog?**

Yes, there is a RISK OF DEATH during surgery, or a complication which may result in death even after.

**How long do you keep dogs in your post-op?**

We keep them for four days in our post-op care center in Janakpuri.

**Can you keep them longer than four days?**

No, unless we determine they are unfit to be released. We also may need to transfer them to another organization or individual in the co-operative if they need more time to recover.

**What are the dogs fed?**

The dogs are fed roti with soup made from “waste” meat bought from butchery leftovers.

 **When  will I be scheduled?**

Once we have all of your information and you have completed our pre-scheduling process we put you on the list to be scheduled. Dogs in our focus area (Rajouri Garden and nearby) get priority. We schedule the surgeries the week before they are done. 

 **NOTE: Do NOT send messages asking to be scheduled. That will delay your surgeries!**

**What if the dog becomes pregnant?**

We can still do the surgery up to a month after a dog becomes pregnant. Please inform us immediately if the dog is crossed, and we will try to prioritize them.

**What do I have to do after the dogs are released?**

The incision is not fully healed after only four days. You must clean the incision once a day with betadine (put on a cotton and dab on the incision) then apply himax ointment.

Occasionally complications occur after release, but most are cleared up with a course of over-the-counter antibiotics. Please WhatsApp us with a picture of the incision if you see the dog licking a lot at the incision, if there is any swelling, discharge, or if it opens significantly.

**Can you return the dog to the vet if complications occur?**

If you are within our focal area then we can definitely help return the dog to the vet for a check up. However if you are outside of this area you will be responsible for returning the dog to the surgeon if complications occur. We may be able to help with transportation, but we can’t guarantee it.

**Do you charge any fees?**

We do not charge any fees for our services. We rely on donations to keep operating, so we ask that you please consider donating towards our work.
