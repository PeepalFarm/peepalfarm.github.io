Good Enterprise
==

We believe, for an enterprise to do net good -

* It should create a product from locally available material, ideally something which is not already being used.
* Do not compete. If the problem you are trying to solve is being solved by someone else, your strengths are better used elsewhere on a problem no one is thinking about.
* The product should not be a filler. It should solve an issue better than its counterparts (if there are any) and do it in a more compassionate way.
* The enterprise will be helping a few people gain monetary resources. Ensure that those people also get exposure to compassion so the resources used are not in a counter productive way.

## Current Ideas

* To help our neighbors who do not want to abandon their non producing cattle, but financially find it difficult to keep them, we are making [cow dung pots](https://blog.badmashpeepal.org/how-to-replace-plastic-with-cow-poop-in-5-steps-dff17bec1c66#.hgh35rvlm) so maintenance cost for keeping retired cattle can be offset. 

## Future Ideas

* Cow urine cleaner
* Cow dung mosquito coils and incense sticks
* Home made Tofu 
* Mats from waste plastic
* Health cookies
* Herbal teas
