Google for Girls
==

The first step to empowerment is knowledge. That is why we are teaching girls in our village how to access the largest source of information: the internet. Our "Google for Girls" classes are giving women aged 15-30 the basics on how to Google to discover new information and how to use a computer to organize it. They will also get their very first email address and instructions on how to use it. With these basics that we take for granted, they have access to whole wide world.
