Badmash Peepal Farm
==========

Badmash Peepal Farm is a natural, organic farm in Himalayan foothills, near Dharamsala, India. It is home to recovering injured stray animals and creatively maladjusted people who want to do animal welfare and animal rights. 

We promote a simple, compassionate and sustainable lifestyle. The farm is open to people who want to live purposefully and do good work without having to worry about food or accommodation. 

We are fostering a collaborative community of independent people who work towards improving the current situation for animals; whether it's directly working with animals, doing hacktivism or doing human welfare coupled with fostering compassion for animals. 

If you want to be part of our community for a month or longer, [check out the kind of work we do and the skills we are seeking](/?p=farmers).
