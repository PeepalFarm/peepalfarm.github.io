Rules
----------

* No drinking or drunkenness at the farm.

* No meat is allowed on the property. Dairy products are ok, but we encourage you to be vegan while here!

* No smoking or eating inside the rooms. You can smoke by the cooking stove on the East side of the building.

* No swearing or aggressive language.

* No animals are allowed in the rooms unless otherwise stated.

* Please don't harvest and eat the produce! We will all starve.

* If you turn anything on, please make sure you turn it off when you finish! This is especially important for our water heater, which uses a lot of power and melts the socket if it is left on.

* Leave things where they are. The chairs are there for a reason, the things are plugged in there for a reason, the furniture in the room is arranged correctly. We don't need Extreme Makeover Home Edition!

* The plumbing and electric are very precarious in rural India. If you see something that seems like a problem or want to change where something is plugged in please DON'T try to fix it! Inform us so we can take care of it.

* The kitchen facilities are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a permanent resident or Veeru, our chef. We have a hot water kettle and filtered water available all day in the community room and outside the kitchen.

* Please remove your shoes before entering the kitchen.

* Please stay on the paths lest you squash a wee plant.

* People who are here as part of the work exchange program, work 36 hours per week (6 hour days, 6 days per week).

* You sign out in the book before leaving the property for more than an hour. That way we know where you are, when you plan to return, and can find you if you fall off a cliff somewhere. Because we care!

* Leave things as you found them, including the community shower and toilet. The community is responsible for cleaning the community toilet. You want to be part of the community, right? Please be sure to clean behind you and if you see the toilet needs a scrub, scrub it! Also pick your hair out of the shower drain. GROSS.

* Please throw used toilet paper in the bin in the bathroom NOT in the toilet! We will have a clogged up septic and you will have to fix it.

* If you generate any non-recyclable or non-biodegradable trash you must store it and take it with you when you leave.

* Respect staff space. The staff rooms, staff toilet, and staff shower are their space. Please do not use them (The only exception is doing laundry in the tusla in the staff shower).

* On the day you arrive and the day that you leave please sun your blankets and clean your room.

* Please keep the rooms clean and tidy. A messy room can attract mice, termites, and cockroaches to the entire house.

* Please don't leave your belongings around the farm or anywhere outside your room. We have trained the dogs to pick things up but we haven't taught them not to shred them!

* If for any reason things are not working out, we reserve the right to ask you to leave on 24 hours notice.

* Do not - DO NOT - feed the animals. Many of them are on special diets or have dietary restrictions that can kill them. Did I mention do not feed the animals? For those folks helping with treatments, do not take initiative and give medications. ALWAYS ask first!

* Please inform us before taking dogs on a walk. If we notice someone is missing it will send us into “search mode”. This is not fun for anyone.

* Please do not stream videos or music on the wifi and disable all auto updates on your devices. We have limited data, so show you care and share!

* Be respectful of others in the community. This means maintaining moderate quiet in work hours and generally think about how your behavior impacts the people around you. Quiet hours are before 7:00 am, and after 9:00 pm.

* Be respectful of our space and our building. A lot of work goes into making a place! Don’t carve you and your love bug’s initials on a tree, step on the landscaping work, or damage the house or furniture. Please be gentle with things!

* If you are going in or out of dog area make sure the first gate is latched behind you before opening the next one. One of the dogs for adoption has it in for the house puppies and she is faster than us.

* Remember that we are here to alleviate the suffering of others. This is our philosophy. Every action should be done with that in mind.



Polite Suggestions
----------

* Please be respectful of local custom. Particularly for women and femme folks (sorry, I know it sucks), this means how you dress is a reflection on you, every other volunteer that will work here in the future, and the residents who live here. Our actions don’t live in a bubble.

Be mindful that sleeveless shirts, short shorts, shorts at all, lots of chest, and tight clothing are considered risque to our neighbors. For your safety, the safety of others, and respect for our neighbors please dress conservatively.

* Please return to the property before dark. Our town is quiet, but it is risky to travel anywhere in India at night.

* Use our great spaces! We have a meditation circle and a yoga area, a lovely long porch, a hammock, and nice rocks under the mango tree.
