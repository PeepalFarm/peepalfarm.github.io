Street Art for Street Dogs.
=====

In India, while dogs are dying on street, majority of people insist on buying a dog from a breeder. Not only did making this art engage close to a hundred people in a matter of hours sensitivizing them to this issue, but this picture on a real wall will continue to inspire for months to come. It will make its way to Facebook walls when people take and post selfies.

We are also making a short film about this. We won't crowdfund for its promotion, but crowdsource it! If you have helped a desi dog, [let us know](?p=contact "contact us"). If you know someone who has helped a desi dog, share this with them. This is your chance to get engaged! It's time to take ‪#‎desilogdesidog‬ to the next level.
