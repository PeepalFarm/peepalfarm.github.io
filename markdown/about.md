About us
======

## Who we are

Badmash Peepal is a multi-faceted community of loosely knit people with one goal; doing good work.  We believe in "alleviating physical pain" as an objective net good. 

"**[Peepal Farm]( /?p=farm)**" is our home space built in Himalayan Foothills to accommodate recovering injured stray animals, creatively maladjusted people who want to do good work, and an organic farm to provide a little bit for for all of us.

## Current Mission

It's dual prong. We are doing short term **service** by doing animal welfare in our stray animal recovery center, contributing towards long term fixes by encouraging and enabling compassion towards animals. Our methods of choice for that are **hactivism**, **community organization** and **good enterprise**.  

## Vision

Bring together a group of people which will continue doing and inspiring good work, and also attempt to bring about lasting change via **culture jamming**, **innovation** and **policy**.

## Philosophy

We believe that every action for survival has a suffering footprint, especially any consumption. So, we believe in mindful consumption and making our survival purposeful by alleviateing suffering.
