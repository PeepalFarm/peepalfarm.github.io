Frequently Asked Questions
=========

## What should I carry?
Apart from your own toiletries and a towel, we suggest that you carry a flash light,a pair of rugged shoes, a rain jacket, a sweater or jacket, water bottle, bug spray and a sleeping sack. 

## Do you have internet?
Yes. Usually it's good enough for WhatsApp, E-mail and Facebook but we can't gurantee its availability. If you desperately need internet, bring your own 3G data stick. Tata Photon and Idea seem to work best here.

## Do you provide a pick-up?
Sorry, no. However, you can get taxis from bus station and if you are coming via flight, you will need to arrange a pickup from a taxi service. We can provide you a few phone numbers.

Not So Frequently Asked Questions
=========

## Are there snakes at the farm?
We don't have permanent resident snakes, but we have seen a few. Himachal does boast India's most venemous snakes.

## Do you have hot showers?
We have bucket showers in the community bathroom. There is a water heater and you can fill up a bucket of hot water.

## How is the cellphone signal
The nearest cell phone tower is still pretty far, so the signal is spotty but not too horrible. The walls are 18" thick and it's hard to get signal inside the rooms. 

## Do you have western toilets
Yes. 

## Are we allowed to cook our own food?
No. We do have an electric kettle available to you for boiling water.
