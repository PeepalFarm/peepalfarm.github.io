Our Work
=========

## [Stray animal recovery](/?p=recovery)
Our stray animal recovery center is a safe place for injured animals which need space to heal, animals looking for a new home, and permanent residents who are retired from the road. We give them medical care and love, and they return our love back ten fold. Animals who can't be brought in due to contagious conditions are treated on street.

## [Farm](/?p=farm)
Our farm feeds us and recovery animals with healthy, organic produce. We grow some of our own food, which passes straight from farm to kitchen and purchase the bulk of rest locally. We try to practice low-till farming, mulch a la Ruth Stout, and we save seeds.

## [Products](/?p=shop)
We sell what we either grow or procure for ourselves, or what we make for ourselves in our kitchen. Of course all products are vegan. Selling products helps us get word out about our work and expose more people to the idea of veganism. 

## [Farmstay](/?p=farmstay)
Our farmstay gives people an opportunity to spend time with dogs, cows and mules and experience farm life and animal welfare for a bit. It gives non vegans a taste of vegan life and lets them expereince how their body feels on a vegan diet, and it gives vegans a sanctuary for a few days where they are surrounded only by people who want to help animals. 

## [Hacktivism](/?p=hacktivism)
Culture jams. Hoaxes. Spoofs. Events. Nudges. Art. Whatever grabs attention and changes perception.

Title: Our initiatives to help animals and other people who help animals.

## In past

Before starting our own initiatives in Delhi and Dharamsala, we were helping other people doing animal welfare work. They were in a tough situation and we were looking for purpose.

* 2013 Friends of IACC; helping Lorraine and Ingrid in Auroville.
* 2014 Animal Rescue Kerala; helping Avis of Animal Rescue Kerala.
* 2014 Fighting cruelty with compassion; helping Dipala


Our product range in infancy. We are still toying with ideas. We have started with "[cow poop pots](https://blog.peepalfarm.org/how-to-replace-plastic-with-cow-poop-in-5-steps-dff17bec1c66#.rih78achu)", lemongrass and mint tea. Selling seeds, tofu, hydrosols, cleaners and few other things are in the plans. 

We have ideas, but these things [emerge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) depending on how slammed are we, how every one's feeling and what kind of crowd we got here.



## [Village programs](/?p=village)
Our presence in the village has been well received and to give back, we have started a few programs to improve the village. 

## [ABC Co-operative](/?p=abc)
Our stray dog spay program. Working with dog feeders, we are creating a lot of "puppy free" pockets.
