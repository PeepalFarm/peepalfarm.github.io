Our Work
=========

Our daily work revolves around maintaining the stray animal recovery center, the farm and the farm stay.

People who come here for [work exchange](/?p=workexchange), participate in the daily work and if they can, they contribute in their own ways like doing art, fundraising, sustainability projects, helping with adoptions, organizing community events etc. 

As a result, unplanned [hacktivism](/?p=hacktivism) and community events which promote compassion [emerge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) now and then.
