About us
======

## Who we are

We are a group of loosely knit people with one goal; doing good work.  We believe in "alleviating physical pain" as an objective net good. So for us, good work is helping alleviate suffering of those who can't help themselves. 

Our **[farm]( /?p=farm)** is the home we have built in Himalayan Foothills to accommodate recovering injured stray animals, people who want to do good work, and an organic garden to provide a little bit for for all of us.

## Vision

To alleviate animal suffering and eradicate the human behaviors that cause it.

## Current Mission

A space for stray animals to heal and be heard and for people who want to be part of that change, based near Dharamshala, India.

<!--
## Strategy & Tactics/methodology

Short term **service** by doing animal welfare
Long term fixes by encouraging and enabling compassion towards animals. 

  Bring together a group of people which will continue doing and inspiring good work, 
  Also via **awareness** (<i>education</i> + <i>culture jamming</i>), **innovation** and **policy**.
Our methods of choice for that are **[hacktivism](/?p=hacktivism)**, **community organization** and **[good enterprise](/?p=good-enterprise)**.  
-->

## Philosophy

We believe that every action for survival has a suffering footprint, especially any consumption. So, we believe in mindful consumption and making our survival purposeful by alleviateing suffering.
